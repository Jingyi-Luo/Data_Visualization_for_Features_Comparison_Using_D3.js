# Data Visualization for Features Comparison Using JavaScript Library D3.js

The HTML file is developed in Brackets using the JavaScript library D3.js to dynamically show and compare the features between two groups of patients using the top-2 principle components (PCs). The interactive interfaces helps view and compare data in a easy and meaningful ways by clicking dots directly, dragging slider, clicking buttons, choosing subgroup through drop-down list. The visualization helps on feature engineering and selection.

## Visualization and Description

In the interface, when click one dot, correspondingly, the normalized mean and one standard deviationtop-10 features  will show. In order to obtain the real values for each dot, just mouse over the dot, then the information box will show those values for this highlighted dot.

When switching from all the patients (orange and blue dots) to the patients only having events for real (green and red dots), just choose the corresponding group from the drop-down list, then the switcing will be fulfilled in the same scatter plot region. It means only one big scatter plot and two small top-10 feature scatter plots exist.

The snapshots for the dynamic interface can be found from the following poster.
